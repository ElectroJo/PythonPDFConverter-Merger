# PythonPDFConverter/Merger
This is a Python script I created as part of a project for a BEGINER Python programming class. The code is very ugly, and probably has a lot of mistakes.

Thus far the only requirements are Python 3 and http://mstamy2.github.io/PyPDF2/ for splitting and merging PDF files, and Microsoft Office for file conversions.

This is very rough and very experimental, use at your own risk. This is my first time really using GitHub, so if I don’t do something right, sorry.
